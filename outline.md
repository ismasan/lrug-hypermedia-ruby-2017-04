* Intro
  * Hypermedia - who knows
  * My take: APIs with links
  * I'll explore the possibilities in Ruby
* Links
  * JSON without links
  * example client code (hardcoded paths)
  * release cycles
  * out of band documentation
  * JSON with HAL links
  * Relation object
  * Entity object
  * method missing
  * example: root, follow link

* Pagination example!!
* link presence encodes permisions and capabilities
